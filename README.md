## Environment

This repo supports two lab paths. Default to **container-first local** for fastest onboarding. Use **Cloud** when you need official Windows images or scale.

## Local 
- Purpose: fastest, lowest-cost, repeatable labs.  
- Recommended software:
  - Docker Desktop (check licensing) or Docker Engine.  
  - Podman (rootless) as a Linux-first alternative.  
  - PowerShell 7+ (`pwsh`) cross-platform.  
  - `git`, `gh` (GitHub CLI), `curl`, `ssh`.  
  - `docker-compose` or `docker compose` for multi-container demos.  
- Minimum host: 8 GB RAM, 4 vCPU, 50 GB disk. Recommended: 16 GB, 8 vCPU, 100 GB.  
- Storage: use local Docker volumes; keep large VM images out of the repo (`assets/images/` only metadata).  
- Runners & registry:
  - Use GHCR (`ghcr.io`) or Docker Hub for images.  
  - Prefer ephemeral or autoscaling runners (Actions Runner Controller / autoscale pools) for cost/security.  

## Cloud 

- **Purpose:** official Windows Server images, networking, scale tests. Choose Azure / AWS / GCP.  
- **Instance guidance:** Windows builds usually need **4+ vCPU** and **8â€“16 GB RAM**. Scale runners with autoscaling groups or Actions Runner Controller (ARC).  
- **Networking:** restrict RDP/SSH to admin IPs. Place runners in private subnets.  
- **Cost control:** use spot/preemptible instances for non-critical runners. Provide `terraform destroy` scripts and automation to tear down test infrastructure.  
- **Quick checks:**
  - VM boots successfully.  
  - SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows) connects.  
  - Runner appears and registers in CI UI (tags: `windows-build`, `linux-build`).
